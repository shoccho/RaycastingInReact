A simple raycaster thingy in made in react

I made it because it sounded somewhat cool in my head RaycastingInReact 

in hindsight its pretty much shit

Javacript is very slow to calculate vertical and horizontal collisions separately, so my implementation is quite hacky for raycasting although after looking at some tutorials I am quite proud that my go to implementation was faster than what most others do

evrything you see on the screen is a div (rendered to make it look like a somewhat 3d world)

checkout experimental_gameloop branch for something of a gameloop ( if you can ignore react shouting at you for maximum update depth reached )
